Kanji Grid

Another fork of kanjigrid, this time from @tsdko/kanjigrid. I was unable to get tsdko's fork working in recent Anki versions, so I used Claude to convert code to the latest Qt frameworks (Qt 6.9+ / PyQt 6.9+).

Works to generate the grid, export as image, or export as HTML. All config options appear working.

> **Tested on**:<br>
> Anki Version ⁨25.07.5 (7172b2d2)⁩<br>
> Python 3.13.7 Qt 6.9.2 Chromium 130<br>
